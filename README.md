### Overview
In our town there is a need for affordable, accessible and energy efficient access to transportation. the CitiBike program offers exactly that model. Our goal is to bring this utility to the hands of our own community in efforts to construct opportunity within our community in terms of transportation and careers.  We looked into key data from the CitiBike program and these findings support the basis that a program of similar structure would benfit our community.

##### Average Trip Duration
The vast amount of trips that take place are under 30 minutes with the most notable trip duration at 5 minutes. This tells us the average amount of money we can expect to make from a ride. with a $1 start fee and 40 cents per minute we can expect to average about $3.00 on average from each ride.

##### Peak Hours (August)
The most demand occours between the hours of 4:00 PM and 7:00 PM, and the least demand is between the hours of2:00 AM and 4:00 AM which is prime time for bike service and repair/retriveal.

##### Starting Locations
Starting Locations shows a geographical heat map of which bike stalls observe the most frequent bike activations, indications include size and color of map markers. Our visualization shows that the city center is the most in demand bike stalls which tells us our city center could be a great place to install our pilot program, and likely to need an early expansion.

##### User Type Trips by Gender
this heatmap shows the two user types (Customer/Subscriber) and what gender they represent. The most Densly populated field is Male Subscriber on Thursday with 259,316 users. The market that we can target would be Female customers as a whole, but specifically on Wednesdays as they only account for 6,191 rides.

##### Checkout Times by Gender
All 3 gender types accounted for average a max ride of about 5 minutes, so that is a staple for us to focus on, and would be smart for us to establish bike stalls roughly 5 minute bike distance from another stall.

##### Trips by Gender (Weekday per Hour)
This heat map clearly shows the demand for transportation to and from work is a driving force of the service. the most utilized times across all demographics are between 6:00 AM - 9:00 AM and 5:00 PM - 7:00 PM Monday through Friday, so we should establish stalls in the higher commerce areas for ease of access to the workforce that uses the service.

##### Trips by Weekday per Hour
It can be infered from this graph that more people use the service in the afternoon than morning, but the commute times once again are performing quite strong during the weekdays, where as the weekends see a more steady flow throughout the hours of 10:00 AM and 7:00 PM. The weekend's best numbers do lack in comparison to weekday evening commute.

### Summary
The CitiBike model is a revolutionary staple in the way people in largely populated areas move around. Commutes are fast (usually around 5 minutes), affordable (on average around $3.00 per ride), accessable to anyone who knows how to ride a bike and has a mobile device, and a wa yo get exercise while reducing carbon footprint. For our pilot program i would suggest establishing 20 bike stalls in our city center nearest the commerce area and 20 stalls in the surrounding neighborhoods for the worktime commuters. we shouyld perform bike service and retrieval from 2:00 AM - 4:00 AM and expect peak usage to be from 4:00 PM - 7:00 PM. 

I would like to see additional data/visulizations to demonstrate the trejectory at which growth took place for CitiBike as well as average fare over time to see if they have increased their prices as inflation has changed or as they gained in popularity.
